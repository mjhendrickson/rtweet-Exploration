# rtweet-Exploration

Work in progress. Exploring rtweet functionality while learning R Markdown. Feedback on either topic is encouraged and appreciated.

The .html file will not render as a true .html file in GitHub (I'm open to recommendations!). I saved [rtweet_Exploration.pdf](https://github.com/mjhendrickson/rtweet-Exploration/blob/master/rtweet%20Exploration.pdf) to make for easier review of the file output.

Initial exploration began [here](https://gist.github.com/mjhendrickson/bf85e176dbb387231d65880036d66097)
